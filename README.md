[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition/releases).


This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.

For complete examples, see

- [multi-port mappings](examples/multi_port_mappings)
- [multi-type env vars](examples/multi_type_env_vars)
- [multiple definitions](examples/multiple_definitions)
- [string env vars](examples/string_env_vars)

For a complete example with automated tests, see [examples/complete](examples/complete) with `bats` and `Terratest` for the example [test](test).

## Providers

No provider.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| command | The command that is passed to the container | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| container\_cpu | The number of cpu units to reserve for the container. This is optional for tasks using Fargate launch type and the total amount of container\_cpu of all containers in a task will need to be lower than the task-level cpu value | `number` | `0` | no |
| container\_definition | Container definition overrides which allows for extra keys or overriding existing keys. | `map` | `{}` | no |
| container\_depends\_on | The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed. The condition can be one of START, COMPLETE, SUCCESS or HEALTHY | <pre>list(object({<br>    containerName = string<br>    condition     = string<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| container\_image | The image used to start the container. Images in the Docker Hub registry available by default | `string` | n/a | yes |
| container\_memory | The amount of memory (in MiB) to allow the container to use. This is a hard limit, if the container attempts to exceed the container\_memory, the container is killed. This field is optional for Fargate launch type and the total amount of container\_memory of all containers in a task will need to be lower than the task memory value | `number` | `null` | no |
| container\_memory\_reservation | The amount of memory (in MiB) to reserve for the container. If container needs to exceed this threshold, it can do so up to the set container\_memory hard limit | `number` | `null` | no |
| container\_name | The name of the container. Up to 255 characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], -, \_ allowed) | `string` | n/a | yes |

| environment\_files | One or more files containing the environment variables to pass to the container. This maps to the --env-file option to docker run. The file must be hosted in Amazon S3. This option is only available to tasks using the EC2 launch type. This is a list of maps | <pre>list(object({<br>    value = string<br>    type  = string<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| essential | Determines whether all other containers in a task are stopped, if this container fails or stops for any reason. Due to how Terraform type casts booleans in json it is required to double quote this value | `bool` | `true` | no |
| extra\_hosts | A list of hostnames and IP address mappings to append to the /etc/hosts file on the container. This is a list of maps | <pre>list(object({<br>    ipAddress = string<br>    hostname  = string<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| firelens\_configuration | The FireLens configuration for the container. This is used to specify and configure a log router for container logs. For more details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_FirelensConfiguration.html | <pre>object({<br>    type    = string<br>    options = map(string)<br>  })</pre> | `null` | no |
| healthcheck | A map containing command (string), timeout, interval (duration in seconds), retries (1-10, number of times to retry before marking container unhealthy), and startPeriod (0-300, optional grace period to wait, in seconds, before failed healthchecks count toward retries) | <pre>object({<br>    command     = list(string)<br>    retries     = number<br>    timeout     = number<br>    interval    = number<br>    startPeriod = number<br>  })</pre> | `null` | no |
| links | List of container names this container can communicate with without port mappings | `list(string)` | `null` | no |

| port\_mappings | The port mappings to configure for the container. This is a list of maps. Each map should contain "containerPort", "hostPort", and "protocol", where "protocol" is one of "tcp" or "udp". If using containers in a task with the awsvpc or host network mode, the hostPort can either be left blank or set to the same value as the containerPort | <pre>list(object({<br>    containerPort = number<br>    hostPort      = number<br>    protocol      = string<br>  }))</pre> | `[]` | no |

| ulimits | Container ulimit settings. This is a list of maps, where each map should contain "name", "hardLimit" and "softLimit" | <pre>list(object({<br>    name      = string<br>    hardLimit = number<br>    softLimit = number<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| user | The user to run as inside the container. Can be any of these formats: user, user:group, uid, uid:gid, user:gid, uid:group | `string` | `"0"` | no |
